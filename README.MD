# Goal: :
- To use Python to post the current Bitcoin (BTC) price in a discord channel.<b>We will be using:<b>The CoinMarketCap API to get the current price of bitcoin<b>IFTTT to recieve the JSON info and send it to Discord

# Note before starting:
- This is currently in a semi-working state.  The Discord applet in IFTTT has its own share of issues<b>![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/ypuQkpZ.png)<b>The script at its current state does what it is supposed to do, but it returns `{"JsonPayload":23538.12}` when it should return `23538.12` in discord
